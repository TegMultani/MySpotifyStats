# MySpotifyStats

MySpotifyStats is web application that allows users to view their top Spotify tracks, artists, and genres over different time periods. Built using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app integrates with the Spotify API to pull user-specific data and present it in an easy-to-read format.
